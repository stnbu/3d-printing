# PuzzBall has three main parts

1. oball -- Outer ball, a hollow sphere about 6" diameter. it has a pin somewhere on its surface that goes "in" and "out" (clicks) by about 4mm
1. iball -- Inner ball, it has grooves (the puzzle) and three recessed holes (puzzle routes around these) at about 45deg south latitude, equidistant. each hole contains a steel ball recessed but just peeking out (1mm) above the balls surface
1. cradle -- A stand/handle that to hold the oball. the oball sits this three-pronged claw-like cradle with three n-magnets at the tips; take three fingers, make a claw, imagine magnets on fingertips. there's a very thin low-friction layer between the magnets and the oball (teflon tape?)

the three recessed iball ball bearings line up exactly with the three magnets and are fixed by the cradle magnets and therefore the iball itself is fixed (trans and rot) to the cradle. the clearance between iball and oball is ~1mm, so that the three balls contact the inside of the oball; they roll around inside.

the oball slides over the cradle magnets. the iball ball bearings try to stay aligned with the magnets. but the do roll and the roll along the inside of the oball

oball can be transparent [sourced, glued hemispheres] or opaque [printed or sourced]

you pop the pin out (free-spin mode), align it with "start" (south pole), pop it in (to the bottom of the groove) and start puzzle solving

in free-spin, the pin would interfere with the cradle arms but don't do that. when the pin is "in" it follows the grooves that route around the ball bearings

"pin" could just be a threaded rod with a rounded tip
